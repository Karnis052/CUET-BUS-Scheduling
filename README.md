It is a simple MERN stack project which handles CUET Scheduling. The project can add a new bus to the list, delete a bus from the list, edit an existing bus, and view a single bus in detail. It can also show all the scheduled buses.
Every scheduled bus contains the driver's name, helper name, trip type[student, Teacher, Office Staff], and trip time. <br/> <br/>
It has features to filter buses according to trip day and trip type. <br/>
The project facilitates a notice system for any unusual time, departure, and destination location. The administration can place notices to draw the attention of bus service users for any change.
