It is a simple MERN stack project which handles CUET Scheduling. The project can add a new bus to the list, delete a bus from the list, edit an existing bus, and view a single bus in detail. It can also show all the scheduled buses.
Every scheduled bus contains the driver's name, helper name, trip type[student, Teacher, Office Staff], and trip time.
